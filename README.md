Feature#2. Ability to create an event, that could remind him through alarm/ notification. i.e. for taking medicines (re-occuring), for one time doctor appointment.

The application should have below features:
1)	Login Page
2)	Dashboard Page to recent events if any
3) Listing location/ events
a.	Search location with name/ contact
b.	Search events by date/ name/ severity
4) Create locations/ events
a. Create location [based on above feature#1]
b. Create events [based on above feature#2]

The following are the technical specifications:
a)	You can use any technology, it will not affect your assessment score.
b)	You are free to design your own GUI.
c)	Mobile local database would be enough to store data. However, if candidate wants other 3rd party DB or service/REST API can be used for storage. 
d)	You can add additional features to the application if you want.
